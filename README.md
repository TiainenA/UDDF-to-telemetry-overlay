# UDDF-to-telemetry-overlay
Small tool to rip diving telemetry from UDDF to series of images to use as overlay

On the current setup (2024-09-27) the UDDF file is saved as CSV using EXCEL and then read as dataframe. The UDDF_CSV_Reader can be replaced with more elegant version later (not wanting to spend too much time on XML wrangling at the moment).
